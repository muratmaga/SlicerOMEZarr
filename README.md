# SlicerOMEZarr

[3D Slicer](https://slicer.org) extension that opens and saves
[OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) (OME-NGFF) images.
Reading and writing go through [ngff-zarr](https://github.com/fideus-labs/ngff-zarr).

OME-Zarr, also called OME-NGFF, is an open format for large multidimensional
images, specified by the [Open Microscopy Environment](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/)
community. An image is cut into compressed chunks, usually stored at several
resolutions, and its physical description (voxel spacing, units, orientation,
channels, labels) is kept next to the pixels as JSON. Imaging archives such as
the [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) and collections such
as the [OME-Zarr Open SciVis Datasets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/OMEZarrOpenSciVisDatasets)
publish images this way. Stores range from megabytes to terabytes and can live
on a local disk, a web server or cloud storage; the same store opens in napari,
Neuroglancer, web viewers and Python.

With this extension, in Slicer:

* **No conversion step.** Drag an `.ome.zarr` directory onto Slicer, or open an
  `https://` or `s3://` address, without making an NRRD or NIfTI copy first.
* **Images larger than memory.** The finest resolution level that fits the
  memory budget loads first. Refine a slice view, with a click or automatically
  while browsing, and it reloads what it shows at a finer level, up to full
  resolution, reading only the chunks it needs.
* **Regular Slicer data.** Images become scalar volumes, labels become label
  maps or segmentations and time series become sequences, so segmentation,
  registration and volume rendering work as usual.
* **Results other tools can read.** Volumes, label maps and segmentations are
  saved as multiscale OME-Zarr, with orientation, label names and colours.

a public two-photon image of GFP-labelled neurons in a marmoset cortex from the
[OME-Zarr Open SciVis Datasets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/OMEZarrOpenSciVisDatasets),
read from S3 (314 MiB at 0.5 µm). Step by step with screenshots: [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md).

## Usage

* Drag an `.ome.zarr` directory onto the Slicer window and pick
  "Load OME-Zarr image".
* `File → Add Data` and select the store's `zarr.json`.
* `File → Save`, choose the "OME-Zarr image" format for a scalar or label map
  volume. Saving a label map into `<image>.ome.zarr/labels/<name>` registers
  it as a label of that image.
* The **OME-Zarr** module lists the resolution levels of a store. Pick a
  level, then either **Load selected level** (the level whole, as an ordinary
  volume) or **Stream selected level** (the coarsest level at once, the
  chosen one read in the background, slice views first). It also refines what
  a slice view shows, loads the region under a Markups ROI, and creates a
  segmentation whose geometry is that region at a chosen level, so the Segment
  Editor works in a box instead of over the whole store. Every control has a
  tooltip saying what it loads and what it costs.
* From Python:

  ```python
  slicer.util.loadNodeFromFile("/data/brain.ome.zarr", "OMEZarr", {"level": 1})
  slicer.util.loadNodeFromFile("s3://ome-zarr-scivis/v0.5/96x2/marmoset_neurons.ome.zarr", "OMEZarr")
  ```

Requires Slicer 5.12 or newer. The `ngff-zarr[remote]` Python package, version
0.47.0 or newer, is installed into Slicer's Python on first use.

## What works

* **Multiscales**: a store opened without picking a level (drag-and-drop,
  Add Data, the Python loader) loads the finest level that fits the memory
  budget, streamed or whole per the module setting. The budget defaults to a
  quarter of the free RAM and can be fixed in the module settings. A message
  says which level was chosen. A level picked in the module is loaded exactly
  as its button says, whole or streamed; the budget never overrides it.
* **Segmentation in a box**: with a region of interest selected (the volume
  rendering's cropping region while the store is rendered), the level table
  shows the region's size at each level and the memory the Segment Editor
  needs to edit it. "Create segmentation from the region at the selected
  level" makes a segmentation with that box, plus a margin of ten empty voxels
  on every side for dilation and smoothing to grow into, as its reference
  geometry and the editor's source volume, so editing a large store costs the
  box, not the store.
* **Refine view**: reloads the block shown by a slice view at the
  finest level that fits the budget, reading only the chunks it needs, and
  overlays it on the coarse volume in that view with the same window/level.
  Each slice view keeps its own block, and refinement can run automatically
  in all three views each time a view stops moving. "New ROI in view" places a
  region of interest on a view, and loading it gives an ordinary volume at the
  level you pick. Time series are refined at the
  time point selected in the sequence browser.
* **Labels**: the `labels` groups of a store load as label map volumes with
  the colours and names of their `image-label` metadata, or as Segmentation
  nodes when that setting is on. A label store can also be dropped on its own,
  and a plain integer store with few distinct values (a mask written without
  `image-label` metadata) is loaded as a label map too.
* **Time series**: the `t` axis loads as a Sequence with a browser, or as a
  single time point.
* **Axes** `t`, `c`, `z`, `y`, `x` in any order. Channels become separate
  volumes named, coloured and windowed from the OMERO metadata. 2D images are
  loaded as single-slice volumes.
* **Geometry**: spacing and origin are converted from the axis units to
  millimetres. RFC-4 anatomical orientation becomes the IJK→RAS direction.
  Without RFC-4 metadata the axes are assumed LPS (the ngff-zarr and ITK
  convention) or RAS, per the module settings, and the load log says so.
* **Display units**: optionally shows lengths in the store's unit (µm, nm).
* **Writing**: scalar volumes, label maps and segmentations as multiscale
  OME-Zarr, with RFC-4 orientation from the IJK→RAS matrix and `image-label`
  names and colours from the colour table or the segments.
* **Stores**: local directories, `.ozx` files, `https://` and `s3://`, and
  bioformats2raw containers (every image series is loaded). S3 is read
  anonymously unless credentials are given in the environment
  (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`) or in the module settings as JSON, along with the
  region or endpoint; `~/.aws` files are not read. Writing
  targets a local directory by design, as in ngff-zarr; upload it afterwards.
* **Memory**: volumes are read slab by slab straight into the VTK buffer, so a
  volume is held once in memory, not twice.
* **Progress and cancel** while reading.

## Modules

* **OME-Zarr** (Informatics): inspects the resolution levels of a store, loads
  a level or a region of interest, refines slice views at full resolution, and
  holds the settings. It also registers the OME-Zarr file reader, file writer
  and drop handler.

## Still to do

* `Add Data → Choose Directory to Add` lists the chunk files instead of the
  store, and `slicer.util.saveNode` ignores a requested file type. Both need
  changes in Slicer core (tracked in issue #1); use drag-and-drop, the
  `zarr.json` file, or the save dialog meanwhile.

## Development

```bash
Slicer --additional-module-paths /path/to/SlicerOMEZarr/OMEZarr
Testing/run_headless_test.sh /path/to/Slicer                       # module self-test under Xvfb
OMEZARR_TEST_REMOTE=1 Testing/run_headless_test.sh /path/to/Slicer # also test an IDR HTTPS store
```

The same self-test runs in GitHub Actions against the latest stable Slicer on
Linux, macOS and Windows.
